      <h1>Design for developers theme</h1>
      <div id="fonts">
        <h2>Fonts & Components</h2>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="img/fonts-img1.jpg" alt="fonts image" /></div>
        <p>
          During the theme I came to realise that font hierarchy is everywhere including websites
          and web designers take advantage of it to draw the viewerâ€™s attention on specific
          information a webpage displays. I learned that there is more to fonts than just size.
          Weight, color, case position and alignment are equally important. In this exercise, I
          introduce a font hierarchy following some valuable tips from the lectures such as using
          display fonts for big and vibrant headings, serif fonts which are visually appealing for
          body text on screens and different shades of neutral color through out sections.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="img/fonts-img2.jpg" alt="fonts image" /></div>

        <p>
          The card design itself in this solution demonstrates most of the font hierarchy measures I
          took to "differentiate" the displayed text information. They pretty much boild down to
          size, color, case and alignment.

      <div id="colors">
        <h2>Colors & Animations</h2>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="img/colors-img1.jpg" alt="colors image" /></div>
        <p>
          In previous classes I learned that color is an essential element in web design,
          influencing the user experience and creating a visual identity for websites. And that web
          designers combinine colors in a way that is visually appealing and aesthetically pleasing
          and introduce color harmony in websites. But in this theme specifically I dove deep into
          the several color harmony terms such as the monochromatic, analogous, complementary, split
          complementary, triadic etc. and things are more clear to me now. In this color exercise I
          kept things simple and implemented a complimentary color harmony using just two colors.
          Turquoise as a primary and red as accent color.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="img/colors-img2.jpg" alt="colors image" /></div>

        <p>
          It is worth mentioning here that the coolest thing I rearned through this exercise is
          switching to a dark mode which really drove me towards a custom css colors-workflow which
          I will carry out to all my next web projects from now and on.
